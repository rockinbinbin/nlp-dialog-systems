Naive Bayes Add-One Smoothing

Hey! I'm trying to figure out what classes to take next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

Well, I'm just coming out of EECS 281 so I'm trying to figure out what upper level CS courses I should take mainly.  
Label: push-general-info

I really liked 370 actually, so I'm thinking something lower level would be more my speed.  
Label: push-general-info

Oh! That actually sounds like a good idea. When you say difficult, are you talking in terms of workload? I want to still take some humanites next semester as well.  
Label: push-general-info

That sounds like a plan then! I think that's most of what I was worried about. Thanks for your help!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello, I was wondering if I could take any classes outside of EECS next semester? I want to see what other classes are like.  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, do you think I will still be able to fulfill my requirements even if I take a class outside my major?  
Label: push-general-info

Great, it's good to know that I'm on track for graduating on time. Thanks a lot!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello  
Label: push-general-info

I was wondering if you needed to take EECS 203 before taking EECS 281  
Label: push-general-info

I am thinking of taking EECS 203, MATH 216, and Physics 140  
Label: push-general-info

Maybe a psych class but I'm not sure yet  
Label: push-general-info

I want to get a dope internship and I feel like all those classes are important  
Label: push-general-info

I am thinking of double majoring psych and cs  
Label: push-general-info

I want to take 16 credits  
Label: push-general-info

nope  
Label: push-general-info

But I took 15 one semester so it can't be that different  
Label: push-general-info

You are the best advisor I have ever had!  
Label: push-general-info

Hi!  
Label: push-general-info

I am interested in UI and would like to take EECS 493 next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

Are there any pre-requisites for the class?  
Label: push-general-info

Great!  
Label: push-general-info

I am interested in Web in general. Is there any class you would recommend taking with 493?  
Label: push-general-info

How heavy is the workload for these two classes?  
Label: push-general-info

Do you think it is okay to take a third EECS class with these two?  
Label: push-general-info

I'll look into that. Thank you so much!  
Label: push-general-info

Hi! I am trying to plan my schedule next semester and I need help selecting courses to take  
Label: push-general-info

I am an Electrical Engineering Major  
Label: push-general-info

I'd like the easiest semester possible, not too many crazy all nighters!  
Label: push-general-info

ok, that sounds interesting, any other class that would work alongside that?  
Label: push-general-info

OK, thank you.  
Label: push-general-info

ok awesome thanks for all your help!  
Label: push-general-info

bye!  
Label: push-general-info

hello  
Label: push-general-info

Hi I was debating when I should take EECS 281  
Label: push-general-info

Alright, is it typically a high work load course?  
Label: push-general-info

hello  
Label: push-general-info

hi. how difficult is eecs407?  
Label: push-general-info

what do you suggest that i take next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

no  
Label: push-general-info

yes i am  
Label: push-general-info

what is a good flex tech credit  
Label: push-general-info

great thank you  
Label: push-general-info

good bye  
Label: push-general-info

Hi,  
Label: push-general-info

How was your weekend?  
Label: push-general-info

I was wondering what course I can take next term?  
Label: push-general-info

No, I found the math is a little bit hard for me.  
Label: push-general-info

And it always took me so much time to figure out the homework....  
Label: push-general-info

Sort of  
Label: push-general-info

And I also took Physics,  the teacher was really good. Most interesting course so far  
Label: push-general-info

Oh I might want to take computer science as a minor.  
Label: push-general-info

What do you think?  
Label: push-general-info

So, about next term what couse do you think I should take. I meant, based on my course history?  
Label: push-general-info

Or can I choose the course in other department?  
Label: push-general-info

ok thank you! I might take EECS281. Project sounds good.  
Label: push-general-info

Hi  
Label: push-general-info

I'm trying to decide what classes to take next semester. It will be my last semester so I want an easier schedule.  
Label: push-general-info

What EECS classes could I take?  
Label: push-general-info

I haven't heard of this course, can you tell me more about it?  
Label: push-general-info

I also want to take more than one EECS course next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

What are the class numbers for these?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay. Do you know anything about the professors that teach these courses? I don't want to take anything with a really boring professor.  
Label: push-general-info

Okay cool. Thanks for your help!  
Label: push-general-info

Hi! I am looking to minor in EECS, and I want to take another elective.  
Label: push-general-info

Cool, is it offered in the morning?  
Label: push-general-info

What is the workload of EECS 281? I will be taking other museum studies courses and want a small workload next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

That is great. Thank you so much for all of your help!  
Label: push-general-info

I will definitely take EECS 281 next semester  
Label: push-general-info

hello! I need help and NOW  
Label: push-general-info

actually, it is pronounced d-a-n-i  
Label: push-general-info

I think im failing eecs can you check for me?  
Label: push-general-info

I suppose so  
Label: push-general-info

like..do i drop off  
Label: push-general-info

out  
Label: push-general-info

okay  
Label: push-general-info

i hear you  
Label: push-general-info

how about physics?  
Label: push-general-info

okay  
Label: push-general-info

im feeling  
Label: push-general-info

sad and lost  
Label: push-general-info

what do you suggest i switch to?  
Label: push-general-info

so it sounds like i should either drop out or just do communications  
Label: push-general-info

i think i get it  
Label: push-general-info

thats all!  
Label: push-general-info

bye joanne!  
Label: push-general-info

Howdy!  
Label: push-general-info

I am looking for advice on which classes to take next semester  
Label: push-general-info

I am equally interested in Software Dev, Theory of Computation, Computing Infrastructure, and Web Dev  
Label: push-general-info

How hard is EECS 281?  
Label: push-general-info

Do you know what time of day that is offered?  
Label: push-general-info

Also, I haven't taken EECS 203. Is that still a pre-req?  
Label: push-general-info

Alrighty. Thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

Have a good day!  
Label: push-general-info

Yes  
Label: push-general-info

Well... I don't think that would be very likely. I do believe I would have contributed to the well being of my fellow soldiers, however.  
Label: push-general-info

They instilled with me a great sense of leadership, which are skills that can be used to help binary numbers resolve their differences and see the middle ground.  
Label: push-general-info

Well it's not his country of birth, but I'd say his drive to achieve the most powerful office in the country is in line with the nature of the American Spirit.  
Label: push-general-info

Last semester it was great! Now I'm in EECS 281 and I'm starting to rethink my life on a very fundamental level.  
Label: push-general-info

That's a good idea actually, the foundations must be really easy!  
Label: push-general-info

I'd say AI or maybe Game Development. Could I design AI's in games as a compromise?  
Label: push-general-info

Well since that foundations class won't be so hard then I think I could handle it. Unless the scale is out of 2...  
Label: push-general-info

Ok thank you very much for giving me the tools to succeed!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello!  
Label: push-general-info

I'm looking for a class to fill my schedule up for next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

I want a class that doesn't meet on Fridays, do you have any suggestions?  
Label: push-general-info

Yes  
Label: push-general-info

EECS485 and SPANISH987  
Label: push-general-info

Ideally I'd like 2 more computer science courses with that  
Label: push-general-info

Yes!  
Label: push-general-info

That sounds good. I'll backpack that class for this semester.  
Label: push-general-info

Oh, those sound like skills I'd like to learn  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, I think I will just stick to these three classes for now  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

You too  
Label: push-general-info

Hi  
Label: push-general-info

Is calculus 2 harder than physics 240?  
Label: push-general-info

thanks!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello!  
Label: push-general-info

Hi, I am currently interested in computer science as a major, and I was wondering if you could suggest me what classes I should take next  
Label: push-general-info

No  
Label: push-general-info

Will I still be on track to graduate? I know a lot of my friends took both 203 and 280 together and are taking 281 next semester, however I know that I can not since I have not taken 203 quite yet.  
Label: push-general-info

Screen Arts  
Label: push-general-info

Actually. CSE. But I'm considering switching. What do you think?  
Label: push-general-info

But isn't Elementary Programming Concepts a pre-req for the others?  
Label: push-general-info

Also, I don't like programming. Can't I drop the major?  
Label: push-general-info

What would you recommend?  
Label: push-general-info

Or maybe I should be a psych major?  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, that sounds good thanks  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you. I appreciate that  
Label: push-general-info

Hello! I'm about to register for classes, but I'm not sure which classes I should take next semester. Can you help me?  
Label: push-general-info

Great! What should I take?  
Label: push-general-info

Yes, that was very helpful!  
Label: push-general-info

I will do that.  
Label: push-general-info

Thanks!  
Label: push-general-info

Bye!  
Label: push-general-info

How are you today  
Label: push-general-info

Can you give some advice to select courses next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

What's the class size of this course?  
Label: push-general-info

That's great  
Label: push-general-info

Does this course have much workload?  
Label: push-general-info

OK, thank you for your suggestion  
Label: push-general-info

Hello ther  
Label: push-general-info

I want to take a class in the morning  
Label: push-general-info

What science classes do you recommend?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, thanks for the help!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello  
Label: push-general-info

What should I take next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Why do you suggest EECS 381?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay. What other classes should I take with it?  
Label: push-general-info

Is that all I need to graduate?  
Label: push-general-info

What other classes do you recommend I take with those two?  
Label: push-general-info

Are you sure math 404 is an easy class?  
Label: push-general-info

What is Math 404 about?  
Label: push-general-info

What if I struggle with differential equations?  
Label: push-general-info

What should I take instead?  
Label: push-general-info

Not really.  
Label: push-general-info

I prefer Software Development  
Label: push-general-info

What time is that class? I prefer afternoon classes.  
Label: push-general-info

Do you have any afternoon classes I could take  
Label: push-general-info

Okay thank you. I'll take EECS 441, 381, and 376  
Label: push-general-info

Goodbye  
Label: push-general-info

Nice to meet you Garrett!  
Label: push-general-info

I agree  
Label: push-general-info

I need some help deciding what classes to take next semester. Did I come to the right place?  
Label: push-general-info

Hurray!  
Label: push-general-info

I like history more but I want to make a lot of money. What should I do?!  
Label: push-general-info

That's the dream! Based on the classes that I've taken so far what are the next courses I should take to work towards a Computer Science degree?  
Label: push-general-info

I've already taken ENGR 101 so I would I still be able to take EECS 183 for credit?  
Label: push-general-info

Dope!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello!  
Label: push-general-info

I am interested in the computer science major.  
Label: push-general-info

Yes, I have taken ENGR 101, EECS 280, and EECS 203.  
Label: push-general-info

Yes, I have also finished my math requirements.  
Label: push-general-info

Which ones?  
Label: push-general-info

Is that all I need to do to complete the major?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh.  
Label: push-general-info

Yea, I don't know what to do now.  
Label: push-general-info

No! What are the requirements for that?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh okay. I will do that then. Can I take those three classes next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

Hi  
Label: push-general-info

I'd like an easy schedule next semester. What courses should I take?

Hello  
Label: push-general-info

I need help picking my last class to take next semester  
Label: push-general-info

I am debating on taking EECS 445 or not  
Label: push-general-info

I have heard it is a bit difficult  
Label: push-general-info

I'm not sure if it is worth taking my last semester  
Label: push-general-info

I think I'll take 214 instead  
Label: push-general-info

I have plenty of semesters to decide  
Label: push-general-info

Does EECS 445 count for the Data Science major?  
Label: push-general-info

AWESOME!  
Label: push-general-info

I think I'll def take 214 so that I can take 445 before I graduate  
Label: push-general-info

Thanks so much  
Label: push-general-info

No and no you are awesome!  
Label: push-general-info

Bye!  
Label: push-general-info

Yes  
Label: push-general-info

Yes  
Label: push-general-info

Yes  
Label: push-general-info

EECS 183  
Label: push-general-info

My TA is mean  
Label: push-general-info

My professor is mean too.  
Label: push-general-info

She can be very angry sometimes.  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you. You are so helpful, in my humble opinion.  
Label: push-general-info

Nope, that's all.  
Label: push-general-info

I'm fine, thanks. I wanted to talk about my classes for next year.  
Label: push-general-info

I was hoping to have a relaxed semester, so I'm hoping for somewhere around 12 credits.  
Label: push-general-info

Yeah, I took engineering 101 and liked it, so I'm hoping to learn more about it.  
Label: push-general-info

Hi professor qijun, i have some questions for next semester's class  
Label: push-general-info

I'm at senior year, and i want to fulfill my graduation requirement  
Label: push-general-info

i think i'm 4 credits away  
Label: push-general-info

That sounds interesting. how's the workload of eecs482  
Label: push-general-info

Also, I'm only free on Tuesday and Thursday. So does 482 fit?  
Label: push-general-info

Great, thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

I was wondering what courses I should take for next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

I'm very interested in the field of software development  
Label: push-general-info

also web development and computing infrastructure  
Label: push-general-info

What would you say the workload is like for that class?  
Label: push-general-info

Is it generally considered an easy course?  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, that sounds good. Do you have any suggestions for other courses?  
Label: push-general-info

That sounds like a good choice, is the staff generally helpful for that class?  
Label: push-general-info

Awesome, I think that's all I needed. Thanks for the advice!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello!  
Label: push-general-info

Yes  
Label: push-general-info

I'm not sure if I should minor is business  
Label: push-general-info

I am fine, and you?  
Label: push-general-info

I'm trying to figure out required courses to take to become a cs major.  
Label: push-general-info

Should I take those two courses together?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh, ok.  How difficult are those two courses together?  
Label: push-general-info

Are those two the only ones I can take towards my major this semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, thank you very much.  I will take those.  
Label: push-general-info

Hello  
Label: push-general-info

I am trying to plan my senior year semester. I am a Junior and for the Fall of 2007 I would like to start taking upper level technical electives, as well as other major requirements.  
Label: push-general-info

I am interested in Robotics, what courses should I take?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay thank you.  
Label: push-general-info

Would you recommend that I take both of those in the same semester or is that too much work?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, can I take either one of them with 478 or must I wait until I have taken both?  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you that was all very helpful.  
Label: push-general-info

No, you have answered all of my questions. Thanks again. Bye  
Label: push-general-info

Hi Kevin!

Label: push-general-info

i didnt do so well, but I passed the course with a C  
Label: push-general-info

okay i Will do so.  
Label: push-general-info

is 370 and 376 a much more lighter course load then?  
Label: push-general-info

so like, half the work of 280?  
Label: push-general-info

or about the same  
Label: push-general-info

??  
Label: push-general-info

im not that into those topics  
Label: push-general-info

ok  
Label: push-general-info

but i need to take those two courses to get my CSE degree right?  
Label: push-general-info

thank you, I will register for those two classes now  
Label: push-general-info

thanks~  
Label: push-general-info

Hello, I have some questions  
Label: push-general-info

What classes should I take next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

I'm interested in Software Development. Is there a good upper-level cs course related to software development?  
Label: push-general-info

Hello?  
Label: push-general-info

So any suggestions regarding software development classes?  
Label: push-general-info

All my friends said that EECS 381 was their least favorite class. Why did they hate it so much?  
Label: push-general-info

What classes other that EECS 381 are good for software dev?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay cool! I'll look into those for sure. Thank you so much!  
Label: push-general-info

Hey I heard could some cool advising done here?  
Label: push-general-info

I'm trying to decide what I should major in, I'm an engineering student  
Label: push-general-info

I was in the microprocessors section with Prof. Chen  
Label: push-general-info

I really enjoyed the logic circuit and processor aspect of the class  
Label: push-general-info

Okay! I'm planning to take Physics 240 and a math class next semester, so I'm looking to add another class, what would you suggest then?  
Label: push-general-info

Huh, okay  
Label: push-general-info

I think I'll take it then  
Label: push-general-info

Thanks!  
Label: push-general-info

Nope  
Label: push-general-info

Hi!  
Label: push-general-info

I would like a morning class.  
Label: push-general-info

Do you have any suggestions?  
Label: push-general-info

I'm interested in software development and computer hardware.  
Label: push-general-info

I've read that EECS 470 is a very time-consuming and difficult class. Is that true?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, I'll take a look at that!  
Label: push-general-info

Do you know who's teaching EECS 481 next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Are there any prerequisites to it besides EECS 281 and EECS 370?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

I'm thinking of taking EECS 481 next semester!  
Label: push-general-info

No, but thank you so much!  
Label: push-general-info

HI  
Label: push-general-info

Im fine, what classes should I take next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Yes  
Label: push-general-info

I am interested in artificial intelligence  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, can you tell me how hard that class is?  
Label: push-general-info

I like medium-sized courses, which class would you recommend, Software Engineering or Web Databases?  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, thank you for your advice.  
Label: push-general-info

Hello!  
Label: push-general-info

I was wondering if EECS 381 would be a good course to take along with EECS 482?  
Label: push-general-info

I have heard that is doable  
Label: push-general-info

Would that delay my graduation?  
Label: push-general-info

I would like to graduate in 3 years  
Label: push-general-info

Should I instead drop my EE major?  
Label: push-general-info

I can just major in CS instead of double majoring  
Label: push-general-info

So instead of EECS 482 is there a class I can take?  
Label: push-general-info

Thanks!  
Label: push-general-info

Oh I was not aware of that!  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you for your time  
Label: push-general-info

Hey, I wanted to ask some questions about my class schedule for the next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

What can you suggest me after taking EECS270 or EECS370? My preferences are a small class size and group project.  
Label: push-general-info

No.  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, awesome. I heard from my friends that the workload for this class is really heavy. What do you think?  
Label: push-general-info

Alright, I need to think about this a little bit more. If I have any other questions, I'll stop by again. Thank you very much!  
Label: push-general-info

Label: push-general-info

I would like to take electives.  
Label: push-general-info

I am interested in computer security and machine learning.  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, cool. I would like to take EECS 388 and EECS 545 next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

Yes!  
Label: push-general-info

Okay awesome. I will take that after.  
Label: push-general-info

Why should I take EECS 482?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh okay. Is it hard?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay great. Thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

I need help deciding what classes to take next semester  
Label: push-general-info

I am currently a junior in computer science  
Label: push-general-info

So far, 281 has been my favorite!  
Label: push-general-info

along with EECS376  
Label: push-general-info

What is the workload like for EECS445?  
Label: push-general-info

I have never done web development but I am eager to learn  
Label: push-general-info

I haven't really been very interested in hardware  
Label: push-general-info

Since that is a requirement maybe I will take EECS370 with either EECS445 or EECS485  
Label: push-general-info

Will definitely be taking EECS370 next semester  
Label: push-general-info

thanks for your help  
Label: push-general-info

Hi!  
Label: push-general-info

I like Japanese & computers ...  
Label: push-general-info

I have taken both, aced em  
Label: push-general-info

What's the difference?  
Label: push-general-info

I use vim because I don't know how to use emacs  
Label: push-general-info

Ok cool I'll do both  
Label: push-general-info

Label: push-general-info

Thank you for yr help  
Label: push-general-info

Hi professor qijun  
Label: push-general-info

yes  
Label: push-general-info

I prefer CS  
Label: push-general-info

Yes, I'm interested in database. How's the workload for EECS 484? Since I will need more time to find a job, I might not choose taking multiple courses with heavy workloads  
Label: push-general-info

That sounds great. What's the class time?  
Label: push-general-info

I can work with that. Thank you professor!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello! Could you suggest any classes that I might want to take?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh yeah that sounds very interesting! What is the course load for EECS 484?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay that sounds perfect! Uhm I am the most interested in software. Are there any other courses you could suggest?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh wow that sounds very interesting! Do you think taking EECS 481 and EECS 484 together would be manageable?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh okay yeah I would want to take another class, are there any other EECS courses that have a lighter load?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay artificial intelligence sounds very interesting, I will consider taking it.  
Label: push-general-info

Is EECS 492 a project based course?  
Label: push-general-info

Hi  
Label: push-general-info

i don't know what classes to take next semester  
Label: push-general-info

Label: push-general-info

eecs492 sounds interesting  
Label: push-general-info

what is the workload for eecs494  
Label: push-general-info

how many hours do i need to devote to eecs376?  
Label: push-general-info

okay i'll take eecs492 and eecs376  
Label: push-general-info

thanks for your help  
Label: push-general-info

Yes  
Label: push-general-info

Practice coding  
Label: push-general-info

Can I take EECS482 next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Could you tell me something about EECS376  
Label: push-general-info

I have no preference.  
Label: push-general-info

Can I select EECS281 in some other semesters?  
Label: push-general-info

Can I select EECS281 in some other semesters?  
Label: push-general-info

Hello!  
Label: push-general-info

I am looking for a moderately difficult class. Not too difficult, however. Do you have any suggestions?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, great! How many people are in that class? I don't like classes that are very small.  
Label: push-general-info

Hmm, okay. Is the information about the time of day that the class will take place available? I like morning classes.  
Label: push-general-info

Siiiiiick. Thanks for your help, advisor guy. I appreciate it!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello, I have most of my requirements done and am figuring out which classes are left for me to take.  
Label: push-general-info

Any ULCS courses that would help me in the job world?  
Label: push-general-info

That's interesting, are there any other courses?  
Label: push-general-info

What are those courses on?  
Label: push-general-info

Those both sound very interesting, thank you.  
Label: push-general-info

No, that is all  
Label: push-general-info

Hello  
Label: push-general-info

My name is Kaushik  
Label: push-general-info

Should I take 281 or 370  
Label: push-general-info

Is that in the morning? I prefer morning classes.  
Label: push-general-info

Okay.  
Label: push-general-info

Can I take 370 with that class?  
Label: push-general-info

What other class should I take then?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay  
Label: push-general-info

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence. Are there any classes related to taht?  
Label: push-general-info

Are there any other classes?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay. Are there any other classes I can take? I like easy classes.  
Label: push-general-info

What is that class?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay that sounds interesting. I have taken 270. Will that be enough?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay. I will take that first. thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

Bye!  
Label: push-general-info

Label: push-general-info

Which would you recommend?  
Label: push-general-info

Could I take all 3?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay sounds great!  
Label: push-general-info

Sign me up!  
Label: push-general-info

Should I also take my upper level spanish class?  
Label: push-general-info

okay, thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

Is Atul Prakash a cool professor?  
Label: push-general-info

Sounds lame, I want to take 381, am I eligible?  
Label: push-general-info

I guess 183 is 381 backwards  
Label: push-general-info

Okay so do you think I'm on track to graduate with a CS degree within 2 semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Wow, this major is too demanding. I think I might get a minor, what are the requires for a CS minor?  
Label: push-general-info

Sounds gross, it looks like 281 is a tough class. I don't think I'll be doing anything in CS. Hope you have a good day!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello  
Label: push-general-info

What are the remaining requirements for me to graduate?  
Label: push-general-info

How many credits do I have remaining in order to graudate?  
Label: push-general-info

How many EECS courses do you suggest taking next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Thanks for your help  
Label: push-general-info

Hello!  
Label: push-general-info

How many credits is that?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh... Well I only need two more credits of flex tech next semester. Are there any other classes you would recommend?  
Label: push-general-info

I heard EECS 481 is a terrible class, but I was planning on taking it for my MDE. What should I do?  
Label: push-general-info

You are not being helpful.  
Label: push-general-info

I'm trying to decide between EECS 445 and EECS 442. Which one is harder?  
Label: push-general-info

I dunno  
Label: push-general-info

I want to try something new  
Label: push-general-info

Also, I really want to work at Google. Which classes will get me a job at Google?  
Label: push-general-info

What is the easiest class I could take to fulfill my requirements?  
Label: push-general-info

Oh really? Why?  
Label: push-general-info

I tend to enjoy all Asians  
Label: push-general-info

Just so you know, you were not very helpful at all.  
Label: push-general-info

Hello  
Label: push-general-info

I'm a junior and I'm in 280 and I don't know what to take next  
Label: push-general-info

What is EECS 370?  
Label: push-general-info

What is EECS 376?  
Label: push-general-info

Which would be easier to take with 281?  
Label: push-general-info

Ok that makes sense  
Label: push-general-info

Hi, I need help choosing what classes to take next semester.  
Label: push-general-info

Yes. What classes can I take as my MDE?  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, have I met the prerequisites for EECS 481?  
Label: push-general-info

What other classes could I take as my MDE?  
Label: push-general-info

Yes I am. How difficult is this class?  
Label: push-general-info

I am worried that this is too heavy of a workload.  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you for your help  
Label: push-general-info

Hi! I have a few quick questions about next semester  
Label: push-general-info

I'm looking for a class with a low to moderate workload with a helpful professor to fulfill some of my upper-level CS courses. Any suggestions?  
Label: push-general-info

YESSSSSS! I am SUPER excited about web tech and apps!!!  
Label: push-general-info

What's a good class to take with EECS 485?  
Label: push-general-info

I really need to take a light load next semester because I am working and applying for jobs.  
Label: push-general-info

I'm not interested in eecs 373 really :/  
Label: push-general-info

Because I don't like computer hardware  
Label: push-general-info

I'm looking for a very helpful professor  
Label: push-general-info

OOOOOOH that sounds so cool! I think that's all I need.  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

Sorry, I was just finishing writing a text message to my friend. Anyway, I came here to discuss my final semester here at the school.  
Label: push-general-info

I need to plan my last semester. I am thinking about taking three 400-level EECS courses.  
Label: push-general-info

Probably something like two software engineering courses, and one other EECS course that is not too code-heavy.  
Label: push-general-info

441 is mobile development, right?  
Label: push-general-info

How about 484? Is that code-heavy?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay, and for my third EECS class, what do you think about EECS 486?  
Label: push-general-info

Do you know if it has a final project?  
Label: push-general-info

Okay thank you for providing me with this information. I think I'll sign up for these three.  
Label: push-general-info

muenster cheese quesadillas  
Label: push-general-info

I do not know. Can you give me some suggestions?  
Label: push-general-info

According to my transcript, apparently not.  
Label: push-general-info

But wait, I forgot! I took Engin 101!!!  
Label: push-general-info

Also, I'm in Engineering. So I can't take EECS 183  
Label: push-general-info

Ok thanks!  
Label: push-general-info

Have a good day!!!  
Label: push-general-info

Yes!  
Label: push-general-info

I wondered whether you could give me any recommendations. I will need 4 credits for next semester but I do not know which is good  
Label: push-general-info

yes I should. What design course do you think is good?  
Label: push-general-info

May I know the description of the course?  
Label: push-general-info

It looks good. I like that.  
Label: push-general-info

How many credits the course will count?  
Label: push-general-info

Does the course have lab? I like labs a lot!  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you! I will take the course  
Label: push-general-info

Good Bye!  
Label: push-general-info

Hey, I think I wanna take Physics 140  
Label: push-general-info

Oh, whoops.  Silly me.  I'm thinking about IOE 474 to finish up my IOE reqs.  
Label: push-general-info

I meant EECS 482  
Label: push-general-info

Which class should I take next?  
Label: push-general-info

Good idea!  Is EECS 203 hard?  
Label: push-general-info

Thanks!  
Label: push-general-info

Hello, how are you?  
Label: push-general-info

Fine, thanks! I am looking for courses that you would recommend I take next semester  
Label: push-general-info

No, so far most of the classes I have taken are IOE classes  
Label: push-general-info

No, I did not like ENGR 101 very much.  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, that sounds good. Are there any other courses you would recommend?  
Label: push-general-info

Yes, I am fine with that  
Label: push-general-info

No, I would prefer a medium workload. I also have a slight interest in computer hardware  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, what other EECS classes would I need to take? I have not taken any yet  
Label: push-general-info

Are there any others I can take next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

Ok, thank you!  
Label: push-general-info

HI  
Label: push-general-info

Can I take EECS 381?  
Label: push-general-info

Who should take EECS 381?  
Label: push-general-info

Would you recommend any other classes?  
Label: push-general-info

I am interested in NLP  
Label: push-general-info

That sounds very interesting  
Label: push-general-info

Can I take EECS 445?  
Label: push-general-info

Next semester?  
Label: push-general-info

I don't think I have the math background  
Label: push-general-info

Is there another similar course?  
Label: push-general-info

Thank you I will think about  
Label: push-general-info
